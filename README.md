## Technologies & Techniques

**Technologies:**

* Visual Studio Code: Website code

* Figma: Layout reference for final webpage

* Git: Used to work in different branches in order to manage the development of the website's features

* Github: Keeping the code for the webpage and hosting it with Github Pages

**Techniques:**

* JSX allows writing HTML and JavaScript in the same file, allowing for an alternative way to structure and reduce code

* Instead of using selectors to get the elements from the DOM, the elements are integrated into the Javscript code

* The website uses an API to store and retrieve data from a server

* Authorization and registration are used in conjunction with protected routes to ensure that only authorized users have access to the website
